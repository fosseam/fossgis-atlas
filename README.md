# FOSSGIS Atlas â€“ Meta Landscape of the Conferences

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (deu) -> liesmich.md

Or in other words: a kind of conference cartography 2025++.

A curated, data-driven meta-archive of the FOSSGIS conferences â€“ structured, visualized, interlinked.

This project collects, structures, and analyzes all publicly available content from the FOSSGIS 2025 conference â€“ including videos, abstracts, slides, and view counts. The goal is to create an interactive meta-landscape that provides orientation within the thematic diversity of the conferences.

Possible data sources:

- [media.ccc.de â€“ FOSSGIS 2025](https://media.ccc.de/c/fossgis2025)
- [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTli5-lbeoia6iMs0ncbq6-N3ngH9Hs5C)
- [Pretalx Conference Schedule](https://pretalx.com/fossgis2025)

## Project Goals

- Three-level taxonomy (Supergroup â†’ Group â†’ Subgroup)
- Master tables with over 200 program items, including talks, workshops, lightning talks, links, durations, and view counts
- Interactive visualizations (heatmaps, tree views, watchlists)
- JupyterLab environment via Binder
- DOI-based releases via Zenodo (Working Paper & Dataset)
